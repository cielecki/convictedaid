What it does?
- Guides you through the entire round structure, showing you only things that you actually need to do.
- Shows you how to distribute action points among players.
- Helps with setting up siege (randomizes opponent, ,randomizes MAD (also checks which section is the weakest),  shows you what to deploy and from what direction).
- When you click a unit it shows you all abilities that affect this specific unit, this also includes abilities from difficulty, race abilities and targeting rules.
- Tracks morale and performs loyalty tests
- Looks up what loot you should receive (both from the loot table as well as the default one that is related to the number of players). Reminds you that you should not take loot if you are fighting a diff 3 Beasts.

Let me know if you have any feedback or comments. What is fun about it is that it should be very easy to extend it with new types of invaders.
